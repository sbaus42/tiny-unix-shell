## Code Structure

The code follows a very basic structure in which the main loop contains two
ways of handling date. The handling depends on whether the code has arguments
or not.
If it does, the execution flow goes into checking the amount of arguments and
then runs with very much the same code that would be ran without. The main
difference between these two flows is how the lines are read (one is a file
and the other is from stdin).

## Spec Handling

For situations such as no input or blank lines, I used the suggested method of
tokenizing the strings. I did two passes at tokenizing. In the first one I moved
every command into its own variable within the commands array. The second pass
removed the blank spaces, tabs and new lines.

## Known Bugs

As of this writing, I believe my code is not entirely concurrent since my tests
for concurrency did not yield good results. When I entered the 'ls' command, I
had the routine check for that particular command and add a 10 sec sleep within
the foked process. It was evident that the whole program slept so it leads me to
believe that concurrency was not achieved.
For this reason quit does not work as intended as well. I was not able to grasp
the concept of using 'waitpid()' and it shows in that way.
